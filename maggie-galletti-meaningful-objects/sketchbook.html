    <div class="description"> This is my sketchbook. I don't draw in it too often anymore (I draw mostly digitally), but it is packed with everything I care about. I've learned over the years how to use a sketchbook and what a sketchbook can mean to you. It can be your own private space and you don't have to share it with anyone, so don't be afraid of making mistakes. On the front is my OC Finley. The back cover and insides are covered in stickers.
