    <div class="description">This is my Splatoon 3 edition OLED Nintendo Switch. I stayed up late to buy it as soon as it came out online, right before it sold out. It is my favorite console I've had, it has various details on the joycons and the back of the console that make it satisfying to own. I put the screen protector on myself and I did an amazing job, you can hardly tell it's there.
