    <div class="description">This is my sad looking Splatoon squid pillow. I bought it back when I went to Nintendo New York. I've had it for 6 years and have slept with it every night so that is why it is very sad looking. My boyfriend bought me a green one and when we went to Japan last summer he bought me a red octo one so now I have one sad pillow and two healthy looking ones.
