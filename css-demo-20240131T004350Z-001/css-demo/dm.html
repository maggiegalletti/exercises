    <h1>Dungeon Master</h1>
    <p>In the <a href="index.html">Dungeons & Dragons</a> (D&D) role-playing game, the Dungeon Master (DM) is the game organizer and participant in charge of creating the details and challenges of a given adventure, while maintaining a realistic continuity of events.[1][2] In effect, the Dungeon Master controls all aspects of the game, except for the actions of the player characters (PCs),[3] and describes to the players what their characters experience.[4] Regular Dungeons & Dragons groups consist of a dungeon master and several players.</p>

    <p>The DM is responsible for narrative flow, creating the scenario and setting in which the game takes place, maintaining the pace and providing dynamic feedback.[6] In storyteller role, the DM is responsible for describing the events of the D&D game session and making rulings about game situations and effects based on the decisions made by the players. The DM can develop the adventure plot and setting in which these PCs participate or use a preexisting module. This is typically designed as a type of decision tree that is followed by the players, and a customized version can require several hours of preparation for each hour spent playing the game.[7]</p>
